                  <!-- <p>In the fall of 2015, a MeetUp event circuilating on Facebook caught my eye. It was NeurotechTO's launch event; t</p>
                  <p>There was, however, a glaring question: why was this innovation only in the hidden-away labs at the University of Toronto? Of course, the material is quite technical and difficult. However, given motivated students willing to learn from each other and do research, neurotech innovation could theoretically happen at the undergraduate level. With this hypothesis in mind, I started NeurotechUofT.</p>
                  <p>Our main goal is to promote and accelerate neurotech innovation. First of all, you need the hardware. This stuff can be ridiculously expensive for an undergrad student (hundreds to thousands of dollars). </p> -->
                  <p>NeurotechUofT is the first undergraduate student club at the University of Toronto devoted to driving undergraduate neurotechnology innovation. We work on neurotech research and development projects suggested and lead by the members of our club. To do this, we provide both the tech to complete these projects and workshops to help you become the ultimate neurotech ninja and contribute to neurotech projects!</p>
                  <h3><a href="https://github.com/neurotechuoft/Wall-EEG">WallEEG</a></h3>
                  <p>A mind-controlled bot! This project boils down to using supervised machine learning techniquest to parse motor thoughts from EEG taken from the pre-motor cortex of the brain. The result is then turned into a command for the drone, making it fly.</p>
                  <h3>Neurotech Starter Pack</h3>
                  <p>A starter pack for neurotech development. It contains code for interfacing with the OpenBCI biosignals board (with observable-observer design pattern for the data), signal processing (BioSPPy) and machine learning on the data, and a cross-platform UI toolkit (Kivy).</p>

                  <p>Flappy Bird in Java! I had learned Java in high school, but most of my university career until second semester of second year was spent coding in Pythone exclusively. Trying to return to Java turned out to be quite hard because frankly, I forgot a lot of the syntax! Flappy Bird seemed like the perfect project to review all the aspects of Java and its syntax (ie how to define member access, constructors, inheritance syntax, etc).</p>

                  <p>An interactive simulation of neurons firing! This project was inspired by what I learnt in PHY254: Mechanics-From Oscillations to Chaos. We dealt with various types of linear and nonlinear oscillators, and I learnt in that class that neurons can actually be modelled as a nonlinear oscillator! All you need is to time-step through a few nonlinear differential equations (which isn't too computationally intensive as long as you don't have too many neurons in the system) and you get to see live neurons interacting with each other!</p>
